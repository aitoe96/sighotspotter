A key goal of regenerative medicine is to restore structure and function of damaged tissues and organs due to disease and ageing. Despite recent advances, the identification of key factors for efficient control of cell phenotype to enable cellular rejuvenation is still a challenge. 
Several computational methods have been useful in designing cellular conversion strategies, however, they mainly rely on gene regulatory network (GRN) models without accounting for the cellular microenvironment (niche), which is important for maintenance of in vivo cellular phenotype.
Our main assumption here is that a cellular phenotype is maintained by the sustained effect of the niche via key signaling molecules. Accordingly, we propose a probabilistic method (SigHotSpotter) to identify such signaling molecules by integrating signaling and transcriptional networks.
Application of SigHotSpotter on several niche dependent cellular systems correctly predicted known niche induced signaling molecules. Importantly, SigHotSpotter outperforms commonly employed signaling pathway enrichment/inference methods

This software is made publicly available in the hope that it can guide 
contribute to the discovery of niche induced signaling molecules for instance in diseased or aged phenotypes, and therefore enable the design of novel
strategies cell
